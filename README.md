These Matlab codes each demonstrate a particular machine learning algorithms. 
Each file includes an animation of a machine learning algorithms in action!

The codes do not call any high-level functions. They illustrate the simplicity 
and power of Matlab, in addition to the machine learning algorithms themselves.
